## pom.xml file
- This file includes the information, configuration details and dependencies used by Maven to build the project. 
- Public dependencies are used.


## configuration.properties file
- This file is the central repository for the common data used in the tests.
- It gives us the advantage to change data from one place instead of going into test files and change data one by one.
- Data is read by ConfigurationReader class which is under the utilities package.


## .feature file
- Test scenarios are written in feature files in Gherkin language format (Given, When, Then)
- Gherkin language is giving us advantage to read test case steps easily without investigating codes especially for the non-technical personnel. 
- Scenarios can be tagged as @smoke, @regression, @test3 to run specific test cases only.
- Scenario Outline is used to run same test case with different data. Data is taken from Examples Table. Instead of writing many similar scenarios, you can write only one test case with dynamic data.
- In scenarios parameters are used to make the scenarios dynamic to used again in other test cases.


## pages package (Page Object Model-POM)
- Page Object Model is used in this package.
- Locators stored in one class which is named of the specific page it belongs, to be able use reuse them easily.
- We can create object from that class and call locators which are stored as WebElement variables.
- When a locator value is changed, we donÂ´t have to investigate all the test suite, we can change the locator from its page class.
- POM increases the reusebility.
